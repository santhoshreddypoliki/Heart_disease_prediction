Heart Disease prediction using Machine Learning models

I had used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters combination and best suitable model for the heart disease prediction.


I had trained the data with these models, 

1. Logistic Regression

2. Support Vector Classifier

3. KNeighbours Classifier

4. Random Forest Classifier
